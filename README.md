# PyGambit
## Chess, in Python

This is a semi-documented progression of a chess engine built using python and pygame! 
I gave a talk on the status of this project as well as key takeaways at Google on 08/24/2021.
The guidance for this project comes from Edward Sharick of Temple University

Note: I am new to Github and adding most of this project to Github ex post facto by slowly moving my work over from OneDrive. 
Please bear with me as I work to learn how to interface with Git and improve the quality and readability of each commit!
